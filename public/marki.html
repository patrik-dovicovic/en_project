            <p>Why did we choose to write a blog?
                Well, our phones got taken, we couldn't do anything about it. We couldn't record anything so after a
                short talk we decided we will try to make a blog. Here it is, we hope yall enjoy it.
            </p>
            <p>Monday morning was the start of the ski trip. We had to go to the school parking lot. When we came there
                we saw a bus already waiting on us so we loaded our things and got to the bus. TBH the road was longer
                than I expected but it was nice we talked played music and we could feel that our class was getting more
                together which was very nice. When we arrived we got keys to our rooms we didn't expect anything special
                but a huge relief was when we found out we had warm water after some time we got our lunch and our first
                skiing session could start we didn't ski much but the main thing was getting us to the group based on
                our ski level. Once that was finished we came back to the hotel and then we had dinner and some free
                time. We weren't allowed to visit each other's rooms so we came up with a walkaround, we were meeting in
                the hall. It was freezing there but it was the only solution left for us. </p>
            <p>Tuesday
                Our day started way too early for us. We had to wake up before 7 am so we had time for everything. We
                went exhausted on the breakfast which was pretty good and then our first full ski day was next we were
                really excited when we got to the ski centrum we went to our group and we were basically skiing the
                whole day when we got to our hotel we had lunch then some free lunch or siesta and the last action was a
                short walk it was pretty nice and we enjoyed this day.
            </p>
            <p>Wednesday
                On Wednesday we started our day a bit later than Tuesday. We knew what to expect in the morning so we
                were lying in our beds until around 7:25, we prepared and went to breakfast. The day was pretty average,
                we were skiing until 2 o'clock when we went back to our hotel to eat lunch and relax. After „free time“
                when we were allowed to just lay in our beds and we couldn't leave our rooms, we went shopping. I
                (Marek) may have won the prize for the most expensive purchase in coop jednota that day. After all that,
                we had our dinner, where they told us that they will only give us our phones if we are going to dance at
                the disco they prepared. Some boys were scared, but we said, why not? After all the disco was amazing,
                we completely destroyed ourselves there. We have been dancing there for nearly 2 hours. It was a lot of
                fun, but it had its consequences, we felt those on the snow the next day.
            </p>
            <p>Thursday
                We woke up totally destroyed. Maybe the dancing wasn't a good idea at all. Whatever, we just had to deal
                with it and enjoy our breakfast. We were skiing 'till 2 and then went on lunch. There was an activity in
                the afternoon. Basically, we were thrown in front of the hotel on a field that was completely covered in
                snow. We were throwing snowballs, throwing each other on the ground, yeah, it was fun. I still have dirt
                marks on my jacket from it. After that, there was another disco, but it wasn't the same as the first
                one. It just didn't have that “vibe”. So tired, and bored, we started packing things because tomorrow we
                were leaving. Good night.

            </p>
            <p>Friday
                The last day. We woke up early, finalized packing and went to breakfast. After that, we've gone skiing
                one last time, but just for 2 hours. We said our goodbyes to Tále and headed back to the hotel. Here we
                dressed in our casual clothes. We hopped on the bus and went home. Nearly everyone slept through the
                way. We were in Bratislava by 4 PM and that is the end of our trip.
                In conclusion, the trip was amazing. It connected a lot of people in our class more, created new or
                better friendships and we all had a lot of fun. We (Marek and Samco) were sadly unable to capture skiing
                because we were in different skiing groups and we couldn't show you a lot in our free time because we
                had no phones. But I think it was a good thing. Without phones, we had to come up with convos and ways
                to cure boredom outside of mobile phones. We hope that this wasn't our last trip with our class and we
                are thrilled for new adventures with all of you, my friends!
