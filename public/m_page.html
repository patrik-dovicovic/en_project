                hunting using one of the most powerful weapons in nature.</p>

            <p>The history of falconry starts in the central Asia 4000 years ago.
                People in this age were dependent on hunting, but they only had wooden javelins and bows so they
                couldn't hunt prey regularly.
                They started stealing the prey from birds. As the days passed they needed more and more food so they
                decided to cooperate with eagles to hunt deer and wolfs.
                Hunters brought chicks from the nest and trained them to hunt the same way that their parents would in
                the wild.
                This method of hunting became more and more popular and falconry started to grow across the whole world.

            <p style="padding-top:30px;" class="modern_world">In modern world falconry became more of an art then a
                hunting method. But in the world full of guns there are still people who prefer this traditional way of
                hunting.
                Birds specialized for hunting:

            <p>Bird breeding is the most important part of falconry in Europe because here, you can't just steal chicks
                from a nest like in America. The only way to own a bird of prey is to buy one. Each bird breeder has
                special mews where birds have minimal contact with people to help breed the perfect hunter with natural
                insticts.
                And I think it's lot of information for today's blog so we can continue next time with some other
                interesting facts about falconry. </p>
